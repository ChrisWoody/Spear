# to do next
- design and implement the world
- spawn points from everywhere
- finalise design of player and enemy
 - further, animate these (even with a very basic spritesheet)

# gameplay to think about
- with the current setup, it's easy for the player to just stand still and kill the enemies as they come in, so need to get them moving around
 - could have the enemies shoot slower-moving lasers or something requiring the player to move around, in which case the player could have health or be insta killed
 - it's possible some enemies can fire lasers and might be slower moving, with faster moving ones melee-only
 - could also indicate that the enemy is about to fire, giving the player a chance to move beforehand
- improve the platforming, especially around the effects of gravity when jumping/falling

- potentially while the spear is impaled, have it kill enemies that move through it
- design and implement the final world, including using box colliders for the world (because tilemap composite isn't very precise)
 - HOWEVER i like the effect of the blood failing down, so can still do that with the box collider?

# nice to haves
- animated world
