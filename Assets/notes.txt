# issues/things to do
- with the current setup, it's easy for the player to just stand still and kill the enemies as they come in, so need to get them moving around
 - could have the enemies shoot slower-moving lasers or something requiring the player to move around, in which case the player could have health or be insta killed 
- improve the platforming, especially around the effects of gravity when jumping/falling
- potentially while the spear is impaled, have it kill enemies that move through it
